    <string name="checkself">If you have been injured in the accident, first check yourself for any injuries. Try to assess how well you can move your limbs, and if you experience symptoms such as dizziness etc. Remember you need to be fit enough to help the others.</string>
    <string name="checkinjury">If other people are injured, first assess the extent of his/ her injuries. For e.g. is he bleeding from the head, neck, arms legs, abdomen back etc. Treat the quietest person first, they are usually more seriously injured or cannot breathe. People who can talk or scream, on the other hand, can breathe therefore can be treated a little later. Ask for the patient’s name, if he responds, it means he is able to understand the situation and has most likely not suffered a severe head injury.</string>
    <string name="breathsigns">Next, check if the person is breathing and if he has a pulse.</string>
    <string name="callhelp">Immediately call for an ambulance or rush the person to a hospital. Once you know more about the patient’s condition you will in a better position to tell the doctors about his/her condition.</string>
    <string name="checkobstruction">If you do not hear any breath sounds, check his/her mouth for any obstructions. If there is something obstructing the airway, use your index and middle finger to clear the airway.</string>
    <string name="lifesaving">If there is no pulse, start CPR or EAR. Keep the person’s neck straight to start EAR (External Air Resuscitation) or CPR (Cardio pulmonary resuscitation).  There are 3 types of EAR; Mouth-to-mouth, Mouth-to-Nose, Mouth-to-Mask.</string>
    <string name="severecondition">If there is bleeding from the mouth or the patient is vomiting, turn the person to his/her side. This will avoid any chances of the person choking. Place the person’s arm that is under him straight out and the arm closest to you across his chest.</string>
    <string name="openwounds">If there are extensive wounds, try to control the bleeding using pressure to the area using a cloth. Press down with your palms rather than your finger tips.</string>
    <string name="spinalinjury">If the person’s neck is in an awkward position (not normally placed) or the person is unconscious, do not move the patient. Get help immediately. This could mean that the person’s neck is broken, and moving him/her in such a situation can cause more harm than good.</string>
    <string name="warmness">Usually accident victims feel excessively cold due to shock. Therefore keeping them warm is essential to survival. You can use whatever you have to do this, such as a T-shirt, jacket, etc.</string>
    <string name="feedingvictim">Do not give the person any water, food or other fluids through the mouth, it could lead to the patient choking.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_victime_transportation">Victim Transportation</string>
    <string name="tip1">\u2022 The patient should be transported on a stretcher or a stiff board. This is important as reducing the amount of movement the person experiences is essential to avoid his/her injuries from becoming worse.</string>
    <string name="tip2">\u2022 Keep the person’s neck and back straight. You could place a rolled up towel or thick cloth under the neck for better support.</string>
    <string name="tip3">\u2022 Ensure that the person is lying down flat.</string>
    <string name="tip4">\u2022 If there is only a limb injury, the patient can be transported in a sitting position.</string>
    <string name="tip5">\u2022 In case of a bleeding injury, lift the injured part above the person’s body level and apply pressure on the region. Keep applying pressure till you reach the hospital. This helps control and eventually stop the bleeding.</string>
    <string name="tip6">\u2022 Make sure the person has a pulse and is breathing on the way to the hospital. If he/she stops breathing, be prepared to start CPR or EAR in the vehicle.</string>
